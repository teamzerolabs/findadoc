A new Developer portal that shows tutorial links and allow you to sort/tag by date/programming language type/difficulty

The problem that this is trying to solve is:
* Provide the best way to show up to date information to developers old and new.
* Google and stackoverflow both can contain outdated information.
* Let's run a portal and actively deprecate old tutorial links!

We are looking for frontend contributors!

Current plan and TODO:
* Check in backend
* Create Post/User/Category/Guide/Project tables in MySQL
* Spin up elastic search for fast pagination and search
* Add admin panel
* Add Google login
* Create language portal
  * Java
  * Python
  * C#
  * Javascript/Node
  * PHP


After go live:
* Ingest 100 links for each Language
* Pick 5 web projects for each Language
* Invite administrators to vote on user submissions
* Add in advertisement to cover server cost/take donations for running cloudfront/elastic beanstalk/elastic search
* Turn the making of the site itself into tutorials links too.

If you'd like to contribute or have any ideas, please reach out at info@teamzerolabs.com

Have a nice day!
